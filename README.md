# Content Downloader Chrome Extension

#### Downloads links(with content) on current webpage.
	
This extension aims at downloading content automatically from any [Rubytapas](https://www.rubytapas.com) screencast page. This only works for subscribed users.


	Inspiration!!!
	Nowadays I am learning Ruby and got a monthly subscription plan
	for Rubytapas. Rubytapas provides you with awesome screencasts for
	learning and mastering Ruby.
	But the problem with watching screencasts as a subscribed user is
	that one has to manually download all available content links on a
	given screencast webpage.
	This chrome extension aims at downloading all those content links
	automatically once browser action button is clicked.
	(Other perfect solutions may exist as well)
